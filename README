True Random Logger

Uses avalanche breakdown from two reversed biased transistors to create 
quantum noise fluctuations. The noise is amplified and then read as an 
analog voltage on the Arduino.

The original program and circuit design is by Rob Seward which can be 
found at http://robseward.com/misc/RNG2/

This implementation takes the program a step further by adding an SD 
card logging capabilities for untethered random awesomeness. 

The random data was tested by the Die Hard randomness test suite and, as 
far as my non statistics brain can tell, the randomness looks good. 
Entropy as measured by ent.exe (not related to die hard suite) is 
7.999999 bits of randomness per byte using ~30MB of test data.
