True Random Logger

Circuit Design and Programming by Rob Seward 2008-2009

I made a post on my blog at http://www.coding-squared.com/blog/?p=49

Uses avalanche breakdown from a reversed biased transistor to create 
quantum noise fluctuations. The noise is amplified and then read as an 
analog voltage on the Arduino.

The original program and circuit design is by Rob Seward which can be 
found at http://robseward.com/misc/RNG2/

This implementation takes the program a step further by adding Serial 
and SD card logging capabilities for random awesomeness.
