###Description
Uses avalanche breakdown from a reversed biased transistor to create quantum noise fluctuations.
The noise is amplified and then read as an analog voltage on the Arduino.
This implementation takes the program a step further by adding Serial and SD card logging capabilities for random awesomeness.
